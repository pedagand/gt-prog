  A reactive operational semantics for a lambda-calculus with time warps


  Many computer systems are reactive: they execute in continuous
  interaction with their environment. From the perspective of
  functional programming, reactive systems can be modeled and
  programmed as stream functions. Several lines of research have
  exploited this point of view. Works based on Nakano’s guarded
  recursion use type-theoretical modalities to guarantee
  productivity. Works based on synchronous programming use more
  specialized methods but guarantee incremental processing of stream
  fragments. In this paper, we contribute to a recent synthesis
  between the two approaches by describing how a language with a
  family of type-theoretical modalities can be given an incremental
  semantics in the synchronous style. We prove that this semantics
  coincides with a more usual big-step semantics.
