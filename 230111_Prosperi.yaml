  Programming distributed systems with Varda


  Assembling off-the-shelf or independently-developed components into a system is a common practice. Although a few useful tools exist, this remains manual, ad-hoc, complex, labour-intensive, and error-prone.

  Varda provides a higher level of abstraction. An Varda program describes how to compose components into a safe architecture. The programmer isolates an off-the-shelf (OTS) component behind an Varda shield, which specifies its interface, its protocol, and its pre- and post-conditions.

  Components can be logically nested, providing encapsulation boundaries; the outer component orchestrates its inner components. It can intercept communication, as a general mechanism to compute over components and messages. Varda provides strong guarantees, enforcing the specification by static analysis, by run-time checks, and by sandboxing. To be useful, Varda takes a pragmatic approach. An OTS adaptor can contain non-Varda code (e.g., Java). Varda provides control over properties such as elasticity, placement, and inlining. Varda supports non-stop execution thanks to supervision mechanisms.
