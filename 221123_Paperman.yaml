what: |
  Vectorial execution of automata

  I will present work in progress on a research programs aiming to compile efficiently automata-model of computation using vectorial instructions and bit-level paralellism.

  The compilation procedure relies on algebraic automata theory that will be gently introduced. Some complexity related consideration will also provides insight on what to expect and what is (probably) hopeless to compile efficiently.
