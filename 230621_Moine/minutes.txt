Diamonds are forever
Heap space bounds

motivation: space is a resource in a separation logic
  Hofmann'99: \diamond 1 "1 space credit"
    right to allocate 1 memory word

without GC: trivial
  diamond is potential
  malloc/free syntactically transfer potential to/from actual

with GC: non-trivial
  `free` may happen at any point
  a suspended thread may produce space leak


ingredient: fractional permission
  points-to p: read-only
  points-to 1: read/write

ingredient: logical model of GC
  `free` is a *ghost* update

ingredient: "pointed-by" relation
  \ell <-|_{p} L are reachable predecessors of \ell

  corollary: \ell <-|_{1} L over-approximates reachable predecessor of \ell

ingredient: ghost thread identifier \pi
  logic: { \phi } \pi : tm { \psi }
  logically identify thread

  pointed-by-thread: l <=|_{p} \Pi

-> logically describe behavior of GC free
   remark: "force-framed rule" is surprising
     [unusual in separation logic]

Specification: atomic triples
  { thread-private precond } < thread-public precond > \pi : term < thread-public post > { thread-private post }

  add: "virtual space credit"
    turn into space credit when full ownership is restored
