  Diamonds Are Forever: Reasoning about Heap Space in a Concurrent and Garbage Collected Language


  Memory management is notoriously difficult in a concurrent
setting. The presence of garbage collection greatly simplifies the
life of the programmer, eradicating many memory-related bugs. However,
the heap space usage of garbage-collected programs can be tricky to
understand and reason about, as there is no explicit program point
where space is reclaimed.

  We recently presented a Separation Logic with Space Credits to
reason about heap space under garbage collection in a high-level, yet
sequential, language.

  In this talk, we scale up to a concurrent language. For this
purpose, we introduce new "pointed-by-thread" assertions, which keep
track of the existence of stack-to-heap pointers in a reasonably
lightweight manner. We illustrate our approach on a range of examples,
including the standard lock-free Treiber's stack, and unveil its
surprisingly high heap memory bounds in the presence of garbage
collection.
